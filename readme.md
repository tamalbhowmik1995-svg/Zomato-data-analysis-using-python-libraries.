1. Importing Libraries:
Begin by importing essential Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization:
2. Loading the Dataset:
Load the Zomato dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Assuming the dataset is in a CSV format:
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA involves visualizing and summarizing the data to uncover patterns and insights. This can include:
Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual columns like rate (e.g., distribution of ratings), cuisine (e.g., most popular cuisines), or online_order (e.g., proportion of restaurants offering online orders).
Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between two variables, such as the correlation between rate and votes, or the average cost for two people across different cuisine types.
Visualizations: Creating bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions and relationships.
4. Deriving Business Insights:
Based on the analysis, you can extract valuable business insights, such as:
Identifying popular cuisines and restaurant types in specific areas.
Understanding customer satisfaction levels based on ratings and reviews.
Analyzing the impact of online ordering availability on restaurant performance.
Identifying areas with high demand for food delivery.
